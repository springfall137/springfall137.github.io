                The next era of space systems will be shaped less by a single breakthrough than by the ability to design
                reliable hardware under extreme conditions—thermal cycling, vibration, shock, radiation, and limited
                chances for repair. At the same time, artificial intelligence is changing how engineers model, optimize,
                and validate complex physical systems. My research objective is to develop AI-assisted simulation and
                design methods that speed up engineering iteration while keeping the reliability required for space
                hardware.

                The core problem I want to address is the gap between speed and trust in engineering computation.
                High-fidelity simulation—such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and finite element analysis
                (FEA)—can be physically accurate, but it becomes slow and expensive when design spaces are large and
                uncertainty must be considered. Purely data-driven models can be fast, but they may fail when conditions
                change or when they are asked to predict outside what they have seen before. In space engineering, this
                is not a minor weakness. The research challenge, therefore, is not simply to "use AI in engineering,"
                but to build AI methods that respect physical laws, represent uncertainty honestly, and can be checked
                and trusted.

                I plan to develop physics-consistent learning models that serve as reliable surrogates for parts of the
                simulation pipeline. Rather than replacing physics-based solvers, the goal is to reduce repeated
                computation in design loops while preserving physical meaning by enforcing governing equations and
                boundary conditions. I will focus on stability and scalability for stiff systems and complex geometries,
                using approaches such as domain decomposition, adaptive training, and model designs that behave more
                like numerical tools than black boxes.

                Building on my physics foundation and my ongoing quantum machine-learning-assisted topology optimization
                work with Tohoku University, I also want to integrate quantum machine learning and quantum algorithms
                into hybrid design workflows—using them to expand exploration and to tackle combinatorial tasks—while
                keeping final decisions anchored in trusted physics simulation.

                Space systems must work despite manufacturing variation, material uncertainty, and changing
                environments. This means the best design is often not the one that is optimal on paper, but the one that
                remains safe and effective under realistic perturbations. I plan to integrate uncertainty quantification
                and reliability metrics into design optimization, so the workflow produces designs with margins that
                engineers can justify. This direction combines efficient surrogate modeling, reliability-aware
                optimization, and verification strategies that determine when high-fidelity simulation must be brought
                back in. The goal is responsible decision-making, not just fast decision-making.

                I want to apply these methods to structural concepts relevant to space hardware: lightweight,
                deployable, and impact-tolerant structures, including deployable structures for small satellites. My
                exposure to architected structures and metamaterial-inspired design has shown me that geometry can
                unlock performance regimes that traditional materials alone cannot. I am actively developing reusable
                kirigami-based impact absorber concepts, where geometric mechanisms and stability transitions absorb
                energy without relying on one-time damage. By combining these structural ideas with AI-assisted
                simulation and reliability-aware optimization, I aim to enable designs that are computationally
                discoverable, manufacturable, and validated through multi-physics analysis rather than intuition alone.

                In a rocket startup environment, I ran injector CFD simulations and learned firsthand how sensitive
                performance predictions can be to modeling choices—and why reliability requires disciplined
                verification. In parallel, my PINN-based turbulence research focused on improving learning efficiency
                without losing physical structure, and I confirmed that incorporating multi-scale basis functions could
                make the model more stable and accurate on unsteady-flow cases. Across both settings, I repeatedly faced
                the same tension: moving fast enough to iterate, while keeping results trustworthy enough to act on.
                Together, these experiences sharpened the problem I now want to solve: closing the gap between speed and
                trust in engineering computation.

                Ultimately, my objective is to help build computational foundations for the next era of space
                systems—where AI accelerates engineering without weakening rigor, and where reliability remains the
                organizing principle even as iteration becomes faster. Methods become truly valuable when adopted at
                scale—across laboratories, industry partners, and engineering programs that depend on reliable
                simulation and fast iteration. I intend to bring these proven workflows into Korea's space and advanced
                manufacturing landscape, where reliability and scale are everyday requirements, and continue improving
                them through long-term collaboration with international partners so that teams on both sides can share
                benchmarks, cross-check assumptions, and refine tools together.
