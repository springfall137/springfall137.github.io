### Greetings! I'm Dahyun Joo. 🤗 


🎓 I'm a graduate student at the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.snu.ac.kr), Seoul National University, working at AISDL (AI-driven Simulation and Design Lab) under [Prof. Do-Nyun Kim](https://aisdl.snu.ac.kr).


🔬 I'm broadly interested in **computational mechanics**, **AI-driven design**, and **simulation-based optimization**. My work focuses on developing advanced simulation and design methodologies that leverage artificial intelligence for engineering applications.
